## About the Reading
[https://medium.com/google-design/everyday-color-theory-59c1ca0770cb] 
this reading follows a exploration of color theory, examining how color is perceived, understood, and applied across history, psychology, and art. It explains that color perception is deeply subjective, shaped by context, individual experience, and even physiological differences such as color blindness. Historically, colors like red have held cultural and symbolic importance since prehistoric times, while thinkers such as Goethe, Newton, Wittgenstein, and Albers have each advanced our understanding of colorâ€™s emotional and perceptual dimensions. The text highlights how light profoundly affects color appearance, as seen in phenomena like the Purkinje shift and materials such as Vantablack. It also discusses the psychological and therapeutic uses of color, emphasizing its power to influence mood and perception. A concluding group exercise encourages participants to apply these ideas through a hands-on collage activity, reinforcing sensitivity to subtle tonal differences and the collaborative nature of color interpretation.
